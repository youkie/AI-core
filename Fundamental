want

how to get that want: form these methods to get that want  (I want these methods, how could I get them )

Learning is a process through input and output. without these peripherals, there exists no learning.

Artificial core is a process that has the ability to learn any method that get things done.

learning is all about to form kinds of methods.

And AI core is all about learning.

Learning is a group behavior. the learning of one can enlight a group individuals.


define of AI ability:
 It can speak(type anything to the screen)
 It can see (monitoring everything we have done with the computer)
 It can hear (accept the information we type to AI core)
 
decompose these inputs and outputs to basic elements.

crosslink all these basic elements to form a Neural Network.

Find out a or several sound learning process to modifies these NN link coeffient. (maybe the computation is too large while learning? it is not a problem using network computing.) 

AI thinking is to form new neural network coefficent based on existing NN coefficents.

The whole NN coeffients is the memory of the AI core.
